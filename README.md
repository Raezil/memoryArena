# Memory Arena Library for Golang
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/Raezil/memoryArena)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/Raezil/memoryArena)
![Test Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/test--coverage-100%25-brightgreen)

Memory Arena Library is a Golang package that consolidates multiple related memory allocations into a single area. This design allows you to free all allocations at once, making memory management simpler and more efficient.

## Features

- **Grouped Memory Allocations:** Manage related objects within a single arena, streamlining your memory organization.
- **Efficient Cleanup:** Release all allocations in one swift operation, simplifying resource management.
- **Concurrency Support:** Use with concurrent operations via a dedicated concurrent arena.
- **AtomicArena:** Lock-free, thread-safe bump allocation for any Go type T, ensuring correct alignment and allowing resets without reallocation.


## Installation

Install the latest version with:

```bash
go get github.com/Raezil/memoryArena@latest
```

Usage Example

Below is an example demonstrating how to create a memory arena, allocate objects, and free them efficiently:

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	. "github.com/Raezil/memoryArena"
)

type Person struct {
	Name string
	Age  int
}

func main() {
	arena, err := NewConcurrentArena[[]Person](100)
	if err != nil {
		return
	}
	obj, _ := NewObject[[]Person](arena, []Person{Person{"Kamil", 27}, Person{"Lukasz", 28}})
	defer Reset(arena)
	fmt.Println(obj)

}
```
## Testing & Benchmarks

Run all tests with race detection:

```bash
go test -v -race ./...
```

Run benchmarks:

```bash
go test -bench=. -benchmem
```
